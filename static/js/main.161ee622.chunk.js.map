First locate\n                  the serial number on the Rolex. Second, find your year of\n                  issuance in the serial number data book. Third, check if your\n                  serial number corresponds with the guarantee certificate.\n                  Fourth, check the production year with your the age of your\n                  Rolex. Fifth, observe the quality of the engraving.\n                  Additionally you can also verify if the year of issuance\n                  corresponds with your box and papers. We will explain these\n                  steps in detail below.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  You may encounter a Rolex without serial number engraved on\n                  the case. Sometimes these are faded due to really heavy wear\n                  or erased by someone. Please note this should be considered a\n                  huge red flag. In case of stolen watches, the serial number\n                  was often erased as this would clear out direct any leads to\n                  the watch. So our advise is to never buy a Rolex without\n                  serial number engraved on the case. For models with the serial\n                  number in the rehaut, the same applies.

This is actually a crucial\n                  step when authenticating a Rolex watch, but as essential as\n                  the serial number itself is, the quality of how the serial\n                  number is engraved on the Rolex is maybe even more important.\n                </p>\n                <p>We perform the following steps:</p>\n                <p>\n                  *Removing the bracelet when the serial number is between the\n                  lugs* Observe the serial number on the case (at 6 oclock in\n                  the rehaut or between the lugs for older models) Check if the\n                  correct serial number is also included on the International\n                  guarantee card or papers Serial number lookup. Verify if it\n                  resonates with the ageing of the watch (see date book below)\n                  During a watch authentication service, details matter the\n                  most. We make sure that the quality of the inscription of the\n                  serial number is done in accordance with the quality and\n                  finishing that is applied by Rolex tools. This is basically\n                  shown by the quality of the engraving that can only be\n                  concluded by an experienced Rolex watchmaker or by comparing\n                  to a real Rolex.\n                </p>\n                <p>We will explain the steps in detail.</p>\n              </section>\n              <div className={styled.margin}>\n                <BlogArticleBanner\n                  className={styled.banner}\n                  title=\"Want to check if a watch is real\"\n                  button=\"Get a free quote\"\n                  list={[\n                    'Components authenticity & condition',\n                    'Serial number and stolen check',\n                    'Timekeeping tests',\n                  ]}\n                  img=\"img/banner/1.png\"\n                />\n              </div>\n              <section>\n                <p>\n                  <strong>\n                    <span className={styled.colorBlue}>Step 1.</span> Removing\n                    the bracelet\n                  </strong>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  If you have a watch sold before 2007, the serial number is\n                  most likely located between the lugs.

Please note, papers and cards can be faked as\n                  well. Make sure to check with a certified watchmaker if the\n                  cards or papers are correct. Another option is to research\n                  which papers or cards would be issued in a certain year. In\n                  our blog about how we authenticated a 2020 Rolex Submariner we\n                  explain how we authenticated the guarantee card.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  In case you dont have a full set (or the papers at least) it\n                  is not possible to verify the Rolex serial number check with\n                  official Rolex papers. Please note, when observing vintage\n                  papers or cards, it can be extremely hard to distinguish if\n                  they are correct. The reason is that you can easily buy\n                  authentic Rolex papers without any serial numbers included on\n                  it and fake it. Thus you can create your own Rolex Guarantee\n                  paper including the serial number of your own Rolex. This will\n                  make sure you fool somebody who thinks the Rolex serial number\n                  check can be performed by just comparing the serial number on\n                  the watch with the papers. With a rough estimate we think\n                  about 70% of the papers for vintage watches are faked. Just\n                  because it is so easy to fake and it gives you a premium of\n                  easy more than €500.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Nevertheless, our Rolex watchmakers do know where to look for.\n                  As said they know what Rolex papers or cards where issued in\n                  which year and also know how how to check the ageing of ink\n                  and perforated serial numbers. This is a craft that comes\n                  close to authenticating or validating a Rembrandt painting.

The model numbers indicate the material of the watch.\n                  Like steel, yellow gold, rose gold and platinum. Which\n                  complications it must have. Like date, chronograph settings\n                  etcetera.

These Rolex clasp codes are also named\n                  bracelet codes. They effectively tell you if a clasp is period\n                  and model correct. Some models were for example issued on\n                  Oyster bracelets and some (also) on jubilee bracelets. In\n                  addition, if you know your watch is from a specific period.\n                  You can check if the clasp and bracelet that comes with it,\n                  can be the original one. We say can be with a reason.

In other words, it will give sense about if\n                  the bracelet was issued with the watch. Many watches,\n                  especially vintage, have replaced bracelets. After wearing a\n                  watch multiple years, the bracelet should be replaced to\n                  ensure you wont lose a watch.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  But, if you now only have a Rolex Submariner case from 1988.\n                  You can easily find a bracelet for sale online on eBay that is\n                  from that same year. And then sell it together. It makes sure\n                  the watch set is correct. But it wasnt originally sold with\n                  that specific bracelet.\n                </p>\n              </section>\n              <section id=\"section_7\">\n                <h2>Why the checks are not waterproof...</h2>\n                <p>\n                  Unfortunately the Rolex serial number check is not waterproof.\n                  Basically it is a number which is engraved in the rehaut of\n                  the Rolex at the 6 oclock hour mark or between the lugs on the\n                  outside of the case.
